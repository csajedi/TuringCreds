# Overview

## Requirements and Logistics

After a survey of literature and existing art, it is clear that no existing, mature platform exists to serve our complex requirements. The only solution is to incrementally build the platform ourselves. This will require significant expertise, manpower and funds for unavoidable expenses. For now, to bootstrap what I hope will one day be a self-sustaining venture we will try to shape our plans to meet grant requirements. Progress on applying for support related to this document will be held in the projects kanban board.
